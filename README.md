# AQI-HPMA115-STM32

Computes AQI (air quality index) using a Honeywell HPMA115-004 and and STM32.

I'm learning how to STM32. Much of this is code-gen from the STM32CubeIDE.

If you're looking, there's a usable Arduino library for this sensor at
[PMSensor-HPMA115](https://github.com/jedp/PMSensor-HPMA115). (Or just search
for it under AQI or HPM etc. in the Arduino Library Manager.)
